Tramline is a new open-source release management platform for reliably and efficiently releasing mobile apps.

It sits alongside your existing release processes and integrates with a boatload of integrations, standardizes your release, and allows you to ship changes with increased confidence.

Tramline does not get in your way and helps reduce a number hours of manual wrangling.
