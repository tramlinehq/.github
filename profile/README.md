Tramline

ğŸ“²ğŸšƒ

Tramline is a new open-source release management platform for reliably and efficiently releasing mobile apps.

It sits alongside your existing release processes and integrates with a boatload of integrations, helps you standardize your release processes and tools, and allows you to ship changes with increased confidence.

Despite claiming to heavy-lift so much, it doesn't get in your way and reduces countless hours of manual wrangling.
